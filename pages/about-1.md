# About

A seasoned veteran of the affiliate industry, Sebastian is a well-known entrepreneur with an unquenchable thirst for technical knowledge. Having previously co-founded and sold two successful affiliate networks, he is now onto his third with Advibe Media, Inc.

Back in 2001 Sebastian founded an email company that grew into one of the top 20 largest senders in volume in all of the U.S. (sending up to 50MMM emails per day). He designed the visionary software that was built from the ground-up and has features that we’re just now starting to see in action (such as behavioral optimization). The success of deliverability of the system drew the attention of future partners such as ValueClick, Vendare Media, and Vennable Inc. – all leaders in the Digital Advertising space at the beginning of the millennium.

One day an opportunity arose that Sebastian could not refuse: to design and build a flight search engine for the Airline industry. To accomplish this massive goal he setup and directed a team of 65 people across three continents. The company created is currently worth almost nine figures and still hosts ticketing for many of the top airlines in the world.

In 2012 Sebastian exited the company to return to his passion, Online Advertising. Ever since his focus has been on marketing, tracking and performance, whether from the publisher or advertiser side. He remains a big promoter of using big-data and AI applied tactics to create maximize theoretical profits.

When’s he’s not behind the computer Sebastian can be found wowing friends with David-Blaine level magician skills or relaxing at home with his wife and three kids.
